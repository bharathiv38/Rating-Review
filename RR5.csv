"Laptop ðŸ’»got dead within a year that with very nominal usage only for e-mail checking and on line school class that's it.Service center confirmed its motherboard issue...they didn't attend service after having product under warranty that too onsite visit...even giving excuses over phone one after another.Importantly, they asked lots of queries If customer buy product online from Amazon etc...even don't recognise online issued valid invoices on registered products. Keep your boxes intact to give proof of your product purchase in case purchase online.",1.0
Very Good product for this price range. 35650Boots within 10 seconds.Never lags. Battery life is also good. Gets 4-5 hours backup.Camera is poor but i rarely use it.256 GB is also seems less but its ssd which is superfast. I had 650gb hdd of older laptop that i converted into portable using casing.Overall i am exhilirated after buying this product.,5.0
"1.Fast boot up and shutdown2.Nice build quality (except keyboard)3.Apps opens very quick4.Track pad is good (gestures works perfect)5 .Great for students - normal office use.6.Screen is not FHD but not bad at all.7.After update restart takes time (very often)8.i3 10th gen is sufficient for normal use but if you can invest more can go for i3 11 gen.So overall experience is positive but only negative i found that it is fastster than my (lenovo Z50-70,intel i7, 8gb ram,4 gb nvidia graphics, 1tb Hdd). Here SSD is the king.I suggest to go with SSD only.",5.0
Go for something better. The laptop has begun giving multiple issues within the first few months.Service is unhelpful. And feels like the govt era service standards by Lenovo.,1.0
Battery life is unbelievable and camera too. I Haven't expect such premium featured laptop in such cheap price. Lucky me! ðŸ˜† i got it for 35k. Just go for it.,5.0

I am writing here after 3 months of use. The performance is only average and I got problems with the OS and keypad multiple times . I work an average of 2-3 hours a day on this laptop. When I try to open any item it open the property box. Upon searching I found out the Alt key is stuck and I need to change the keypad. I could never get peace with it after buying it.,1.0

The laptop is fast durable and very light weight and it has the power of Intel Core i3 10 Gen Chip so it's way faster then the 8 or 9 Gen Chips.Make sure that if you want the performance as mine just go for the (4+256) variant. Even if you're a very intensive user this thing can set you for years along...,5.0

"Got this delivered on 19th aug'20. The packaging inside was fine however, the amazon box was open from one side when delivered.Was disappointed with 2 things -1. The weight of this laptop is 2.16 kgs and NOT 1.6 Kgs , in product description it was mentioned 1.6 kgs.2. Battery life is not more than 2.5 hrs if working continuously , when fully charged it shows 4 -4.5 hours however this is not the case.Am still working and checking on various features thus limiting right now to these 2 points , have yet to check on camera. Sound seems fine.Video quality (you tube etc) is ok , since it depends on your wi-fi network too.I had picked this model thinking that it will be slim and mainly light weight since i use ""Thinkpad X1 Carbon"" which is quite light to carry around ( 1.2-1.3 kgs).",2.0
"I've been using this laptop since July 2020 and honestly, Lenovo's quality has amazed me. I've always been a fan of IdeaPad's keys - they flow effortlessly with one's typing speed. Screen brightness maybe a problem if you use it outdoors but fast boot-ups and decent display quality compensates for it. At this price point, the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i is easily among the top 3 picks.",4.0

"I liked everything except color reproduction. The display quality is extremely good, bu the lack of a balanced saturation and vibrancy make the images look dull and desaturated. Thus the film viewing experience is not that great.  But apart from that its a pretty amazing and decent laptop at this price range.p.s. This laptop has got one of the best audio performance which needs a special mention.",3.0
