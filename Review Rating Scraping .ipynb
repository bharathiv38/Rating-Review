This knob locks or unlocks the plates.  Now, this knob has a design flaw.  Since this knob is not smooth to operate, the locking and unlocking take time and effort.  Plus there is always a threat that the knob may get damaged or it may break.2. The outer side of the curved edges is ideally not supposed to heat.  When you turn on the product and start using it, the outer edges will touch any part of the skin across your head or neck.  Now if the outer cover also gets heated at a very high temperature and if this part gets in touch with your skin, image what will happen.3. There are 3 ways by which you can shape your hair, straight, curly and zig-zag.  These shapes are given by plates.  However, if I am using one plate, it is expected that the other 2 plates should not heat, however, this does not happen.  All the plates are heated at once, thereby wastage of electricity and risk of burning your skin.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.',\n",

No temperature control, gets heated beyond what you are comfortable with for your hair.2. Besides the inner metal plate, the entire top half of the product also gets heated on the outside body and chances are you could easily burn yourself on your face while holding it close. Your fingers may also get burnt if they move upwards on the iron body while you are straightening your hair.3. The heating plates in the straightener are flat and not elevated like in others, so the grip on the hair is pretty lose, with hair falling out constantly.4.The so called Cold tip at the end of the straightener is not so cold after all, and you cannot hold it comfortably, so you lack grip.5. The swivel cord is good but it is very short.All in all I felt they have compromised on design and quality to offer more feautures, but that is not ok with me.Product returned.',\n",

Crimper is best among the three,crimps stay for quite some time but soft not very sharp crimps....curls come out really well but stay for 2 minutes maximum,have to put hardening spray to keep the curl set that too the curl starts opening in spite of the spray.....straingtner is completely ineffective....so you are basically buying a crimper',\n",

Battery life is not more than 2.5 hrs if working continuously , when fully charged it shows 4 -4.5 hours however this is not the case.Am still working and checking on various features thus limiting right now to these 2 points , have yet to check on camera. Sound seems fine.Video quality (you tube etc) is ok , since it depends on your wi-fi network too.I had picked this model thinking that it will be slim and mainly light weight since i use \"Thinkpad X1 Carbon\" which is quite light to carry around ( 1.2-1.3 kgs).',\n",
