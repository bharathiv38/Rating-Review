Its looks good for 100Rs. I don't know how long the magnet in it gonna last.Its OK if you are gonna need it for household use.I wouldn't recommend it to do heavy work on daily basis. Its not comfortable enough and wouldn't last long. Made in China : what more can you expect .READ MORE,4
"**DETAILED REVIEW**after using the item for the first 2days the following are the main pros nd cons..‚úì‚úìPros:-it has all 32 pieces (including tweaser)-the magnet has good attractive force(the screws also gets attached to it)-the rubber grip on the handle is good.-the case given with it stores all the pieces in place,thus none of them cannot be lost.-the tweaser/plucker has a curved end thus enabling to get into small places .√ó√óCons:-the product is not of Jackly,it's name is ""impact""...READ MORE",4

"If you never had a screwdriver set for small devices, then this is good as a starter kit. The bits are essentially less than 10 but adding different sizes it counts up to 32 bits. You need to have really good eye sight to see the difference in the tips since there are no legends on the box. So the tweezer is your best friend here, especially when dealing with the tiny screws.

First of all according to price the material delivered is ok and you can do your delicate work with delicate hands. Don't use like normal screw drives because it is for small screws and not for heavy  duty. If you have to repair mobile and laptop aur small works you can definitely go for it..(disclaimer.. this is not a paid promotion as some of companies giving  theircustomers a100 bucks to do so...so be alert!!!!..)READ MORE,4

"Mine arrived with a skewed holder (main body). Needed it urgently so couldn't replace it. The build quality is ofcourse not terrific, as it is probably the cheapest one on flipkart with these many attachments. Does light jobs around the house, opened my nerf gun and ps controller with ease. Didn't try on a mobile, but it would surely work. Good enough for use once in a fortnight, definitely not enough to be relied on daily.READ MORE",3

"The magnetic holder of the driver is very weak, oftentimes the driver bit falls off the driver just after one simple twist to the screw. Moreover, the driver is bent near the magnetic holder, which obviously complicates things. I didn't return the set because I didn't have the time or the patience to cope with another faulty replacement of the same thing. Overall, this set is ""just fine"" considering that I got this at Rs.109.READ MORE",2
