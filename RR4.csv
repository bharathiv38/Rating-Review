"Curler and Crimper is good.Straightener is not so good.In crimper, it gives you light crimp.Curler is very nice.Make sure before styling use hair spray , it will help you to set your hair in proper style.",5.0
"1st one I ordered was a bit damaged.. so I replaced it.. nd now this one. It's working great.. all the three.. straighter,crimper and curler works very well.. will definitely suggest you to buy this product.. it's worth buying",5.0
This product is just awesome... Firstly i was confused by seeing the reviews... But after using it .. it is amazing...,5.0
"There is a BIG design flaw. Let us look at each flaw.1. There is a knob that helps to switch between the different blades or plates as per the requirement.  This knob locks or unlocks the plates.  Now, this knob has a design flaw.  Since this knob is not smooth to operate, the locking and unlocking take time and effort.  Plus there is always a threat that the knob may get damaged or it may break.2. The outer side of the curved edges is ideally not supposed to heat.  When you turn on the product and start using it, the outer edges will touch any part of the skin across your head or neck.  Now if the outer cover also gets heated at a very high temperature and if this part gets in touch with your skin, image what will happen.3. There are 3 ways by which you can shape your hair, straight, curly and zig-zag.  These shapes are given by plates.  However, if I am using one plate, it is expected that the other 2 plates should not heat, however, this does not happen.  All the plates are heated at once, thereby wastage of electricity and risk of burning your skin.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.",1.0
"Got tempted by the Vega brand and the discounted price, but it turned out to be a substandard product. There is NO TEMPERATURE CONTROL on this thing!!! How can you have a hair straightner and curler without a temperature control and auto cut off !! Most inconvenient to use. Big Mistake. Kindly avoid buying this.",2.0
I was not happy with the product and I had to return it. I bought it a week ago and returned it yesterday bcz of several drawbacks. Initially I was quite satisfied with it but then gradually I realised it heats up so much that I burnt my finger while straightening.It doesn't have temperature control and also the outer area of the straightener becomes too hot and it also takes so much time to cool down after switching it off. The curler just doesn't works. Crimper is not very effective. The straightener works well though but I can get a better one in lesser price.Overall the product is not good if you want something that does your work quickly and efficiently.,2.0
"While the product is made to look good with its black and gold matt look, and sold with 3 features in 1, it has some Major design flaws which are not acceptable from a brand like Vega.1. No temperature control, gets heated beyond what you are comfortable with for your hair.2. Besides the inner metal plate, the entire top half of the product also gets heated on the outside body and chances are you could easily burn yourself on your face while holding it close. Your fingers may also get burnt if they move upwards on the iron body while you are straightening your hair.3. The heating plates in the straightener are flat and not elevated like in others, so the grip on the hair is pretty lose, with hair falling out constantly.4.The so called Cold tip at the end of the straightener is not so cold after all, and you cannot hold it comfortably, so you lack grip.5. The swivel cord is good but it is very short.All in all I felt they have compromised on design and quality to offer more feautures, but that is not ok with me.Product returned.",1.0
Vega is a big brand hence I trusted the brand.But it turned out to be totally disappointing product.it doesn't have temp control hence it get heated up way too much coz of which i burnt my forehead.And straigthning doesn't last long!,1.0
"We mighy go for this product as it is 3 in 1 for such a cheap price. But please consider these before buying.There is no heat setting.Since it's 3 in 1 , it's held by a small plastic lock. Should be handled very carefully.Straightening is okay , but the finish isnt as expected.Crimper is good.Curler is quite average.All the 3 plates get heated up at once.For a rare use its really a good product.",4.0
Well first got the product checked it it was working......than when I used for second time...the light won't start.....a waste....can't refund also ....as date of refund has gone...waste of money...plus dealer has not stamp on warranty card...so cnt repair it in warranty.....such a waste of my money...please don't buy it .....,1.0
"Very disappointed with the product, straightener isn't working properly, curl isn't working properly, only crumbal was amazing, don't buy it.",1.0
"As it is combination of curler, whole body is getting hot, because of this reason it  burnt my scalp and fingers.  we should BE CAUTIOUS while using it and should hold it only on tips. No temperature control, and one switch is there to change the product for all 3 uses, but that switch is little fragile. Apart from these drawbacks this is a nice product, where we can carry it easily and use it in 3 different ways.",3.0

"There are many ways to use the product which i surely appreciate and that has attracted me. But it gets high in temperature where i have got hurt as well,no temperature control is there which is very important.Product is fine without temperature control. You can try on your choice.",3.0
In 1300 you will get roller straight iron and crimper.Crimper works great.Roller also work great.Only draw back with straightner that it has extremely small ediges to hold. You would end up burning fingers.It is a good product to buy. Doesn't heat up too much and give decent straight hair.,5.0
"One of the most useless product ever purchased on Amazon. Was searching for curler but got tempted to buy this with Vega brand name. Shouldn't have overlooked other reviews. Curler and straightener doesn't wotk at all, crimpler works a bit. No thermostat for automatic temperature control and very inconvenient to operate alone. Total waste as not returnable.",1.0
I ordered this product with lot of expectations and it did not fulfill it. Its curler & straightener are not working properly. I am very disappointed.Please do not order it. Order philips product instead of it as I have done.,1.0
Product was in bad packaging and it was defective.Now coming to product it's not that great prd as outer surface heats up very fast.Curling is a difficult taskusing this prd.,2.0
"The product was damage when it arrives, because of the long exchange process i didnt ask for refund or exchange,  i have to use a hairband for using curler, üò©Straightening part of the product is a big NO NO!Well i dont use crimper so idk, i think its fine!N curler is fine too..The wire used in this product is surely going to blast one day im sure about it.. So i'm Not so satisfied with the product as well as with amazon..  üôè",2.0
I have been usingvthis product for over an year now. Its a good multipurpose product that gives a good crimping and rollersBut this get heats up immensly which can hurt so bad and you need to very careful while handling it.. also it just have 2 small corners with which u can hold it otherwise the hole rode gets heat up,4.0
"I bought it for ‚Çπ 1100/-Low quality as per body material & finishing of the product.. also you cannot control the temperature or there is no temperature display.. that is a disadvantage..Easy to use.. 3 in 1 (curls, waves, straighten)You dont get very effective and long lasting straightened hair by 2-3 strokes.. you have to give it 4/5 strokes..But Overall not so bad.. value for money..",3.0
The make is good and made up of good quality material. Only thing is we need to handle it with care do not drop it on ground.Heating : quickly it gets sufficient heat and able to hairdo fast.Be safe while doing curls or any style close to ears or skin. It will burn the place if it is touched even for a seconds.,5.0
"Good for crimping and curling but don't think the curls last's for hours, should definitely use spray for long lasting.  Not 100% perfect Straighten hair but soft's the messy hair and last's for few hours. Cons- while Crimping the top of the tool become too hot so it's difficult to hold and press your hair into the rod. So it's an 4-star rated Product.",4.0
"Do NOT BUY THIS STUPID PRODUCTThere is no temp control, the rod on the other hand gets so hot that you burn your fingers. And, if you dont hold it with some glove or something theres no way you can use it.DONT BUY EVEN IF IT IS ON DISCOUNT",1.0
"I got this one for 1099 but it's actual Mrp is 1800... Amazing deal in which you can have straightener, Curler and crimper at the same time in one product ... Overall its a good product, travel friendly... And also its from a trustworthy company VEGA... I'm so happy with this product.. The only this is that you can't touch the black part like when you're using crimper or straightener remember you don't touch the black portion",5.0
"Worst product to choose.. at first I thought I received detected piece but its the manufacturing defect. There is too much gap between the curling iron and straightening rod which doesn't straighten the hair as desired, secondly if by any chance you mistakenly touch the part above the handle you'll burn easily because it doesn't have any coating to hold on for convenience... thirdly you'll habe severe hair loss because your hair gets stuck either between the curling rod or in the nuts/nails.. forthly they have fooled us by mentioning return/ replacement.. but they offer no such option to return it, rather just have exchage/replacement option",1.0
Can only be used by professionals or people who are good at handling it ... it's also heavy and the temperature cannot be changed ...  rearly have to press on to hair to make the functions workBetter to buy individual sets,3.0
The product was sold by Single vendor and each time the vendor is giving used products1) First time I got a product where the Product is giving tickling noise when we plug into electrical socket. Noise and fluctuations in led light and we asked for replacement2) Second product is used one with box open and few nob was in damaged condition while delivering itself informed as product box was damaged and product was damaged. So raised a refund option3) Raised a new order request and got product today  in which Straightener is not at all working and while curling getting smoke in dry hairWhy delivering such products which is having issue in each time.Having lots of stress while getting these kind of products each time with complaintsCan Amazon have a look into this issue and do the needful please,1.0
It's waste of momey.The straightener is of no use.I have bought it for straitner but not working.The warranty card do not have deal stamp.And the box was open when I received the product.Don't know if it's original or not.Over all not satisfied.Wanted to return it but they are accepting replacement only.If like cheated. Will not recommend to buy it.one more thing it do not have temperature control.,1.0
The curler and crimper was quite impressive yet the  styler over heats also there is no heat protection system in the design hence caused a lot of burns on my skin as well as when placed on a fabric (literally got my pillow burnt) and highly not safe for a comfortable usage .defenitely cant use as a straightner since hair gets stuck in between the plates,2.0
Packaging was very bad. Device is a little bent too. Not very sure how devices are supposed to work since this was my first hair styling device! Gonna replace it. If I get a better one ill know the difference. I think this is a used 1. Probably will edit my review once i receive the new 1.,3.0
If u looking for cheaper multifunctional styling tool then go for it but the straighter u are expecting is not tht kind of it has consThe straighter requires some pressure but when u do tht even if u hold for some seconds u get ur hands burn ...u get hurtThe crimper is really good then any alone in the market and the curler is ok ok u get fine curles its very handy the reason I bought this coz I need to travel a lot and it gives me space since its one multi tool.,4.0
"Over all a Nice product..I am satisfied but few points to note before but.The heating plate is very narrow, it's should have been little more wider.The pricing is way to high as per it's  other competitors.I would have given 5* if price rages between Rs999-1199/-",4.0

its very good 3 n 1 hair styler.. its all three thing working great on my hair its very very good according to the price.. the only thing i feel is the lock button is not that smooth otherwise its totally worth the money and its heat an up very fast its smooth on your hair also...,4.0
"The product was delivered timely. The product box was open from one side. However, I'm satisfied with the product and it's features. Very helpful for crimping, straightening and curling the hair. Smartly designed product for easy handling.",4.0
"I deslike, I realised it heats up so much that I burnt my finger and skin while straightening.It doesn't have temperature control and also the outer area of the straightener becomes too hot and it also takes so much time to cool down after switching it off.Overall the product is not good becouse outer case too much heat if tuch your skin immediately harm your skin.",2.0
"Though the company claims that it's a 3 in 1 product... But I will tell you the fact. So far the straightener and curlor are confined... It is not upto the mark... Very disappointing... U just say no, not at all.. But when it comes to the crimper... It's good... So if u want then go for it... N i must say this product doesn't accepts return request so must think before purchasing... I took it in 1400 but it is easily available on different sites on just 1200.. I wish before purchasing I should go through the reviews.. That's all about the product.",4.0
"I tried to crimp my hair, but the hair were not properly crimped and the curler was also not upto the mark. Just one suggestion please don't buy this machine. Useless machine.",1.0
"1st:- thing is product is meant for straightening of hair, and while straitening the hairs one get hurt oneself because the product is highly unsafe.2nd :-the upper part of the product is also heat up,  when you use this for straightening so you can not use this safely.3rd:- buy straightener and crumpler differentely bcoz you can straightening your hair without need of anyone help but if you try to crumple you will definitely burn your selfI bought this product for solving the two purpose by one product but trust it's a bad idea.",1.0
"It is easy to use .... Crimper is best among the three,crimps stay for quite some time but soft not very sharp crimps....curls come out really well but stay for 2 minutes maximum,have to put hardening spray to keep the curl set that too the curl starts opening in spite of the spray.....straingtner is completely ineffective....so you are basically buying a crimper",2.0
I am surprised there is no other reviews where it mentioned that the product gets heated on the outside too.Unlike other straighting products only the inside plates gets heated but this model the inside and outside gets heated which is very dangerous as it easy to touch while using it.Please avoid,2.0
"A good budget friendly hair styler. Does the job pretty well. Took a couple of tries to handle it comfortably as this is my first ever styler, but is easy to use. The cord is pretty long. There is no temperature control, only a on-off switch. Also the barrel becomes quite hot, so be careful while working close to face.",4.0
This 3in one hair styler is soo nice and easy to use in this i love the crimper the most ..u should also buy this as it is worth buying it..its amazing and i also love the fast delivery of amazon firsty i received this with locker doesn't working while locking both curler and straightener but then i replaced it and this replacement also completed in within one day that's awesome..and now i have a completely perfect one ..u should buy this its awesome.. seriously..,5.0
Not to say much about this product. But it is just good if you see the price. Hair need certain heat to get hold but this product is not up to the mark. Good go in straightening and crimping but for curls zero results.,5.0
"The best part is the crimper.. then straighting and then comes the curler.. the product is good but u have to be extra careful while using it as the whole upper part of the machine (excluding the tip, thank God) starts getting heated up and can burn ur fingers or neck or chin. Overall its good in this price and I liked it..",4.0
Product is good as per price but needs to be used consciously as it's outer body gets heated very much....I got my fingers burnt. It's very good for straighting but crimping is bad.,4.0
"Not a single time when it hasn't burnt my hands and scalp. The heat plate should not be fixed like this, pls try to use the product first and then launch it in the market, philips is still the best as far as the safety your skin is concerned",1.0

"All good in product, except of width, as a professional I was needed an inch more wider for crimping, but as this is 2 in 1 so this can be accepted. You can buy, no doubt this is a best product for domestic use.",4.0
If you're looking for a budget friendly and super cool hair styling machine then this vega 3 in 1 hair styler is what anyone must go for ! It's really very amazing. I got my parcel in the afternoon and tried all 3 hair styles and it turned out to be very perfect!! Loved the Straightener curler and crimper vega hair styler !! Thank you Amazon and Vega! 100% satisfied!!,5.0
Iam quite happy with this styler as it gives a beautiful texture to my hair at home in budget. I have done a demo of its usage in one of my videos in YouTube channel named 'Niharika Manibalan' where I am using this Vega 3 in 1 hair styler to give volume to my thin hair. Do check out the same.,5.0

See in box there is no sonam kapoor picture is there and as its said that if u do any style then it will stay until u wash but last night i have crimped and morning it just dissappeared so upset with the product really bad experience. Its not working properly means heating or it is not giving good result as the product name 3 in 1 not a single one style it gives good such a disguisting first bad experience upset with amazon buying!!! One more thing it is actually duplicate proof its stick two sticker in the box. Such a rubbish,1.0
It's a good product. It says 3 in one... But I could only conveniently use the crimper and straightener. The curler doesn't look like very effective.Flaws: the body of the products heats up unlike products like croma(I've been using for several years now). That's the major problem. You've to be extremely careful to avoid burns.Pros the crimper is quite good .,4.0
3rd class product.. worst i must say.. i wish i had more words to just hate this product.. the product is not what it claims to be.. worst crimper.. and the curler it sucks and straightener it just below that.. i wish i could give negative stars if they were available.. wasted 1100rs for this useless product and there's no return refund policy.. i am helpless.. amd this product deserves to be in dustbin.. just spoiled my day and expectations..,1.0
"Pathetic product. Heats from the outside too. It burnt my fingers badly. It's just a waste of money. Doesn't work properly, no temp control, the plates are too narrow for straigtning and crimping and the barrel is too small and only gives you tight messy curls. It's not at all a safe product.",1.0
The straightener and crimper work perfectly. The curling is kind of tricky and we need a good hands on to easily do it. But still a preferable product for a person who needs to perform curling rarely,4.0

Worst product. After replacement i didn't get the right product and in warranty card clearly written that it's not liable without the seller stamp and signature then also they didn't provide the stamp and signature of the seller after my complaint.

Nice all in one package !!! But the  putter roller can Burn your skin if you are not using it carefully... overall gives desired results,4.0
Donor buy. Grip is loose. Can‚Äôt hold hair for ironing. Gets too hot can cause burn. Temp goes from zero to too hot too soon. The three Setting button looks loose already and will soon be a case of free lock.Hugely disappointed that I cannot even return it or replace it with a better model. So stuck.,1.0
The product could have been made more easy to handle.I burnt my fingers as the corner gripper is too small to hold.Curler doesn't work that great.But straightner and cripper are good.Over all an ok ok product.,3.0
"In the 3 style i love the crimper it works good than others, straightner is ok bt taking more tym, curler also ok bt it needs more patient if u have a helper then its more good. Bt i love the crimper it is so sooo good.",5.0
The product is good but one has to be very careful while using. Good chances of burning fingers in process since the grip area is pretty small...you have to hold it in one hand at the base and very carefully press with the tip of your fingers at the tip of the styler roll to properly crimp or straighten hair,3.0
"The crimp curl Or straightened hair, nothing last long.... Better go for separate items. It also wastes electricity as all the three gets heates up at same time.. Not that easy to use...",3.0

HiI have my friend using the same item and I cross checked with her. As per her the front part of this item should not get heat up but the item I have is not the same.

Wonderful product but you need to learn to use it. Just there's one problem and that's its temperature control.it gets very hot in less time and we might burn ourselves some time.but just loved it according to the price,5.0
I feel it is a total waste of money for people with thin hair...the grip is not proper so it hardly does the ironing part... Did not expect something like this with such big brand,2.0
"It's good product for DIY. Not any issue after using more than 1yr, if you are thinking for giving gift for your wife and budget product you can go for it.",5.0
The product is good.But the packaging is very poor.They just rapped it in a plastic with no safety. At least they should have given it in a proper box.Any electronic item should be given in box rather than in plastic.I'm very disappointed with the packaging.,3.0
For the price it's really worth it. You might have a little bit of difficulties while using it like getting burnt because there is no insulation on the outer part of heating plate. So take precautions. But you get to style your hair in different ways so it's totally worth.,4.0
"It‚Äôs my genuine review about vega hair straightener, I am really not satisfied with this product. This is okay for long hair women‚Äôs not for short hair",2.0
You should know how to use only after that it is suitable for you. It controls the temperature properly but you should know for how much time it should be in touch with your hair.,5.0
"In this price it is really a good product. It provides you multiple functions like straightening, crimping and curling in one product. Although the crimping doesn't last longer if you won't apply hair spray afterwards. Only drawback is that there is no temperature control buttons.",4.0
I found product is faulty. There is no proper grip to hold hair in the tong. Outer side of hair styler heats a lot and hence is super inconvenient to hold. I hurt my fingers.Immediately I wanted to return but window was not open and now i see it's closed.I need my refund back.,1.0
"i am  suprise the product dilever complete but open the parcel the Straightener box two side  all ready open and  see 3 in 1 button  switch  not stasified  long time switch is not  comfortable use everyone. i am return this iteam click not rplacement . so i am not stasified with this iteam straight hair and crimper not properly work,",1.0
This product is 3 in 1. So when we use it for crimper or straightener due to curler in it middle part is also heated. No temperature control. It becomes heated very much how much time we hold can't calculate. I could not got very sharp crimper and curler. I m returning it,3.0
I find it difficult to use as I'm using it for the first time. Otherwise it's a good product with 3 different use.,4.0
I don't like at all I used straighter but it was need too much time like 15 to 20 minutes and didn't straight properly before I used Vega  I used Philips it's properly work and don't need too much time I suggest don't buy,1.0
Its my first product that i have bought from amazon and i am very disappointed by packaging of the product.. Packaging is very very poor. When I received the parcel box was completely broken. Both box and product was separated. Very disappointing. Otherwise product was nice.,4.0
