"Pretty good , super good than what I tght Worth-able but weights are plastic but cool nice üòçüòçREAD MORE",5
Its really nice. Using it from past 1 week and have no complains. It contains 4 plates of 2 kg and 4 plates of 3 kg. Rod is also of good quality. Getting such a good product at this price range is amazing. Go for it.READ MORE,5
Dumbbells are good but rod and locks are not upto the mark.  Locks are very important in plate dumbbells and hence giving less rating otherwise excellent product. loved it.READ MORE,3

"So far Good. It's only been a week. Bought this first week of June 2020.Yes, it's not metal weights and it's clearly mentioned in the description, so I don't know why people say they don't like it because it's not metal.A few negatives i found is that, the bolts that hold the plates are cheap quality and I feel they will break soon. I hope I'm wrong.Other thing is that, you will get tired of rotating the bolt.It's too many, and i feel it is a workout on its own.Major inconvenience to say...READ MORE",4

"Two rods and six plates, of 2.5kg each, supplied.That means three plates to one dumbbell. How is it possible ?Instead of six plates of 2.5 kg, it would have beenbetter if four plates of 2.5 kg each and four plates of 1.25 kg each were supplied. The supplier respondedthat the weight they had sent was ok.  A reply withoutany imagination !!!These led to the return.READ MORE",5

The product is very good. Plates and rod are of good quality. Nuts are of plastic and it takes time to fix. But it is not a problem i suppose. Should wait to see how does it wear and tear. Width of plates is high and only two plates will fit on one side. But that's enough as the weights are high.READ MORE,5

"It does not solve the purpose, when you have to change the  weights. Evry time you put in or drop rhe weight you are required to un screw rod and evry time your 2-3 mins are gone And you need up taking more time un between your sets. It's ceamented weights with plastic rod makes it look big but not accurate at weights. Not preffered in above scenario. If you gona use weight fix everytime in each year exercise it might sound well for you. At max could go up ro 12.5 weight per double.READ MORE",2

"Dumbbells are good , but still the nut system sucks, fitting the nuts delays my workout time gap, like between 1 set a normal person takes 40-50 secs but adjusting plates and all takes 2-3 minutes because of the tight nuts, because of lockdown i have bought these or would have returned it.READ MORE",3

Plastic nuts become loose within 4-5 times after use. The whole purpose of the dumbbell is lost as it becomes unusable as weights easily fall off. Don't understand how Flipkart can allow these to be sold without considering safety of home users.READ MORE,1
